Etools -- miscellaneous portage utilities
=========================================

Etools consists of some small miscellaneous portage utilities.  Currently
these tools are most suitable to get a grand overview of changes you have
made to your system, which might be specially handy when you want to copy
over your configurations to another machine or when you make a fresh
install.

Please note that I have quickly written these scripts to scratch an itch.
They seam to work fine and I have taken the extra effort to document them,
but use them at your own risk.

Ebuilds are available at
http://github.com/tarsius/overlay-confsink/tree/master/app-portage/etools/.

Echanged
--------

linketl:echanged[1] lists packages which own modified files.  This is
similar to `equery check <pkgspec>` but more suitable to get a grand
overview of the changes to all packages on your system.

Elone
-----

linketl:elone[1] lists files not owned by any package.  Since there likely
exist many files that are not owned by any package */etc/eclone.conf*
contains patterns for files known to be listed by elone.

Env-reload
----------

linketl:env-reload[1] updates and reloads environment settings
automatically.

Profile-stack
-------------

linketl:profile-stack[1] shows a stack of the parent profiles of the
specified portage profile and optionally the contained files.
