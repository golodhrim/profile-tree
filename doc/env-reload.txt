env-reload(1)
=============

NAME
----
env-reload - update and reload environment settings automatically

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'[.|source] env-reload' [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Env-reload updates and reloads environment settings automatically.

If you source or call this script as root the environment settings are
first updated using `env-update`, as a regular user this step is skipped.

Then `/etc/profile` and if it exists `~/.bash_profile` are sourced, this
step is skipped if you do not *source* `env-reload`.

WHY
---

It has always slightly annoyed me that I had to type two commands to
bring my environment up-to-date.  But when I changed the way `bash` init
scripts source each other to be more like what the `bash` documentation
recommends this increased to three commands and that I wouldn't take
anymore. :)

OPTIONS
-------

--version::
        Show version information and exit.

-h::
--help::
        Show help message and exit.
