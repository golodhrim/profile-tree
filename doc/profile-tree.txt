NAME
----
profile-tree - list portage profiles in a tree-like format

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'profile-tree [-c[=REGEXP]] [PROFILE]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

profile-tree lists the paths to portage profiles and optionally their
contents in a tree-like format.  PROFILE defaults to the active profile
if omitted.  Otherwise it has to be an absolute path or a path relative
to the current directory or relative to `PORTDIR/profiles`.

The list is in reverse chronological order - it starts with PROFILE resp.
the current profile and ends with the profile which is loaded first.

Profiles in parentheses do not contain any files that hold any meaning to
portage(5) except for `parent' and `deprecated'.  These files are listed
`/etc/make.profile/` in portage(5).

Profiles that contain the `deprecated` file and profiles loaded more than
once are shown with a prefix indicating the problem.

When `-c` is specified the contents of the profiles is also listed; again
excluding `parent` and `deprecated` and all unknown files.  If `REGEXP`
is provided only matching files are shown. All profiles are shown without
parentheses in this case.
