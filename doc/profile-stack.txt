NAME
----
profile-stack - show stack of parent profiles of a portage profile

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'profile-stack' [-h] [-v] [PROFILE]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

profile-stack shows a stack of the parent profiles of the specified
portage profile.  PROFILE defaults to the active profile if omitted.
Otherwise it has to be an absolute or relative path; or a path relative
to `PORTDIR/profiles`.

The stack starts with the requested profile and ends with the profile
which is loaded first.  Profiles in parentheses do not contain any
configuration themselfs, they only contain a `parent` file.  They may
contain `eapi` or `ChangeLog`.  Profiles in angle brackets will be loaded
again later.

When `-v` is specified files in the profiles are also listed; excluding
`parent`, `eapi` and `ChangeLog`.
