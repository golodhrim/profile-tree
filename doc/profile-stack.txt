profile-stack(1)
================

NAME
----
profile-stack - show stack of parent profiles of a portage profile

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'profile-stack' [-c[=REGEXP]] [PROFILE]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

profile-stack shows a stack of the parent profiles of the specified
portage profile.  PROFILE defaults to the active profile if omitted.
Otherwise it has to be an absolute or relative path; or a path relative
to `PORTDIR/profiles`.

The stack starts with the requested profile and ends with the profile
which is loaded first.  Profiles in parentheses do not contain any
configuration themselfs.  This means they contain none of the files
listed under `/etc/make.profile/` in portage(5) except maybe `parent`
and `deprecated` which are not considered here.

Profiles that contain the `deprecated` file and profiles loaded more
than once are shown with a prefix indicating the problem.

When `-c` is specified the content of the profiles is also listed; again
excluding `parent` and `deprecated` and all unknown files.  If `REGEXP`
is provided only matching files are shown.  Don't start `REGEXP` with `^`.
All profiles are shown without parentheses in this case.
