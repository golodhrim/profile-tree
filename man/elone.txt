NAME
----
elone - list files not owned by any package

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'elone' [OPTIONS] [PATH]...

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Elone lists files not owned by any package (installed using portage or a
compatible package manager).  Since there likely exist many files that are
not owned by any package */etc/eclone.conf* contains patterns for files
not to be listed by elone.

Think of */etc/elone.conf* as a list of files known not to belong to any
package, it starts out with a list of such files that exist on most gentoo
installations.  Use `--no-exclude` in order not to read this file.  If you
want to read exclude patterns from a different file use `--exclude`.

Unless `PATH` or `--protected` is provided list all files not explicitly
excluded.  By providing `PATH` (optionally multiple times) the search is
limited to the given directories.  Option `--protected` limits the search
to config protected files.
